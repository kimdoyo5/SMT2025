Every year, coaches across ballparks emphasize the importance of hustle—hustle around the bases, hustle after the ball, even hustle in and out of the dugout.

Despite widespread acknowledgment, the **concept of *hustle*** remains relegated to conventional wisdom rather than quantitative analysis.  

In contemporary baseball analytics, player evaluations are centered around “talent” metrics, such as *maximum* swing power, throw velocity, and sprint speed; the word “hustle” appears only on rare occasions.  

Nonetheless, beneath every powerful swing, hard throw, and a fast sprint there is a **deliberate intent** to exert maximal effort.

  *Can we quantitatively measure hustle?*  
  *Is there such a thing as a “hustle culture”?*  
  *Can teams actually win games by hustling?*  

This project aims to answer these questions by quantifying hustle and its influence on game outcomes.
